Which rookie will be the 2016-17 Kia Rookie of the Year?
Pick A Card: Kris Dunn
Check out the game pick-a-card with Timberwolves rookie Kris Dunn.

1. Kris Dunn, Minnesota -- 29.0%
2. Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers -- 25.8%
3. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia -- 19.4%
Others receiving votes: DeAndre Bembry, Atlanta; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia; Damian Jones, Golden State; Skal Labissiere, Sacramento; Taurean Prince, Atlanta; Malachi Richardson, Sacramento; Dario Saric, Philadelphia; Pascal Siakam, Toronto
Last year: Jahlil Okafor -- 41.9%
Worth noting: This makes four straight years where the No. 1 pick was not selected by his fellow rookies to win the Kia Rookie of the Year award. Of course, the No. 1 pick has been the Kia Rookie of the Year each of the last two seasons.
Which rookie will have the best career?
All-Access: Simmons vs. Ingram
Listen in as Philadelphia 76ers number 1 pick Ben Simmons duels against Los Angeles Lakers number 2 pick Brandon Ingram during Las Vegas Summer League

1. Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers -- 26.7%
2. Kris Dunn, Minnesota -- 16.7%
3. Buddy Hield, New Orleans -- 13.3%
T-4. Dragan Bender, Phoenix -- 6.7%
Jaylen Brown, Boston -- 6.7%
Jamal Murray, Denver -- 6.7%
Ben Simmons, Philadelphia -- 6.7%
Others receiving votes: Dejounte Murray, San Antonio; Dario Saric, Philadelphia; Pascal Siakam, Toronto; Tyler Ulis, Phoenix; Denzel Valentine, Chicago
Last year: Jahlil Okafor -- 24.1%
Worth noting: Following Jabari Parker in 2014 and Jahlil Okafor in 2015, Ingram is the fourth straight Duke Blue Devil to receive the most votes on this question. There was a time when Dukies were thought to have consistently underwhelming NBA careers.
Which rookie was the biggest steal at where he was selected in the Draft?
1. Dejounte Murray (29), San Antonio -- 16.1%
2. Tyler Ulis (34), Phoenix -- 12.9%
T-3. Malcolm Brogdon (36), Milwaukee -- 6.5%
Jaylen Brown (3), Boston -- 6.5%
Kay Felder (54), Cleveland -- 6.5%
Skal Labissiere (28), Sacramento -- 6.5%
Thon Maker (10), Milwaukee -- 6.5%
Isaiah Whitehead (42), Brooklyn -- 6.5%
Others receiving votes: DeAndre Bembry (21), Atlanta; Marquese Chriss (8), Phoenix; Cheick Diallo (33), New Orleans; Kris Dunn (5), Minnesota; Brice Johnson (25), L.A. Clippers; Damian Jones (30), Golden State; Jake Layman (47), Portland; Timothe Luwawu (24), Philadelphia; Ben Simmons (1), Philadelphia; Stephen Zimmerman (41), Orlando
Last year: Joe Young -- 12.1%
Worth noting: It wouldn't be the first time the Spurs got a quality player outside the Lottery. In fact, Murray is the third Spur -- following DeJuan Blair in 2009 and Kyle Anderson in 2014 -- to receive the most votes here, though the question was phrased as "Which rookie is being most overlooked?" until last year.
Which rookie is the most athletic?
Brown Drives and Dunks
Jaylen Brown gets his defender off his feet then drives in and throws down the monster dunk.

1. Jaylen Brown, Boston -- 38.7%
2. Brice Johnson, L.A. Clippers -- 16.1%
3. Marquese Chriss, Phoenix -- 9.7%
T-4. Malik Beasley, Denver -- 6.5%
Kay Felder, Cleveland -- 6.5%
Gary Payton II, Houston -- 6.5%
Others receiving votes: Wade Baldwin, Memphis; Cheick Diallo, New Orleans; Jake Layman, Portland; Ben Simmons, Philadelphia; Tyler Ulis, Phoenix
Last year: Justin Anderson -- 27.8%
Worth noting: Brown didn't take part in speed and agility testing at the Draft Combine, where the highest max vertical leap belonged to Felder and the fastest lane agility time belonged to Utah's Joel Bolomboy. Previous top vote-getters for this question include Al Thornton, Terrico White and Tony Mitchell. The No. 3 pick will probably have a longer NBA career than those guys did.
Which rookie is the best shooter?
NBA Rooks: Buddy Hield
Sights and sounds courtesy of 6th overall pick Buddy Hield as he's drafted by the New Orleans Pelicans and begins his career at the Las Vegas Summer League.

1. Buddy Hield, New Orleans -- 65.7%
2. Jamal Murray, Denver -- 20.0%
Others receiving votes: Kris Dunn, Minnesota; Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers; Brice Johnson, L.A. Clippers; Timothe Luwawu, Philadelphia; Malachi Richardson, Sacramento
Last year: Devin Booker -- 58.8%
Worth noting: These rooks respect the guys (Dunn and Hield) who played four years in college. Hield, who shot 46 percent from 3-point range as a senior at Oklahoma, received the most votes for any single question this year and the most votes for this question since Stephen Curry received 79 percent in 2009.
Which rookie is the best defender?
1. Kris Dunn, Minnesota -- 23.5%
2. Gary Payton II, Houston -- 20.6%
3. Malcolm Brogdon, Milwaukee -- 17.6%
4. Tyler Ulis, Phoenix -- 8.8%
T-5. Jaylen Brown, Boston -- 5.9%
Kay Felder, Cleveland -- 5.9%
Others receiving votes: Cheick Diallo, New Orleans; Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers; Demetrius Jackson, Boston; Brice Johnson, L.A. Clippers; Jakob Poeltl, Toronto; Taurean Prince, Atlanta
Last year: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson -- 23.5%
Worth noting: Dunn was the top vote-getter for five different questions. In the previous seven editions of the survey, the only other players to be the sole top vote-getter for more than two questions were Blake Griffin (3 in 2009) and John Wall (3 in 2010). The guy who finished second here has a legacy to live up to. His dad earned one of the best nicknames in NBA history -- "The Glove" -- for his defense.
