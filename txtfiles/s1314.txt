Fellow rookies think C.J. McCollum is destined to shine bright in Portland.
T-1st: C.J. McCollum, Portland & Victor Oladipo, Orlando -- 24.2 percent
3: Kelly Olynyk, Boston -- 18.2 percent
4: Trey Burke, Utah -- 12.1 percent
5: Ben McLemore, Sacramento -- 6.1 percent
Others receiving votes: Anthony Bennett, Cleveland; Michael Carter-Williams, Philadelphia; Ray McCallum, Sacramento; Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia; Otto Porter, Washington
Worth noting: McCollum is an interesting pick, given that he'll be sharing minutes and touches with reigning Rookie of the Year Damian Lillard. But it's clear from the total amount of votes he received on all the questions that his fellow rookies believe he's a player. That's good news for the Blazers, no matter what his role is.
Which rookie will have the best career?
T-1st: Victor Oladipo, Orlando & Kelly Olynyk, Boston -- 18.2 percent
NBA Rooks: Kelly Olynyk
3: C.J. McCollum, Portland -- 15.2 percent
4: Cody Zeller, Charlotte -- 9.1 percent
T-5: Anthony Bennett, Cleveland, Tim Hardaway, Jr., New York & Otto Porter, Washington -- 6.1 percent
Others receiving votes: Isaiah Canaan, Houston; Michael Carter-Williams, Philadelphia; Solomon Hill, Indiana; Ray McCallum, Sacramento; Ben McLemore, Sacramento; Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn; Peyton Siva, Detroit
Worth noting: The top four picks picked up 39 percent of the vote. The No. 5 pick? Alex Len (Phoenix) didn't receive a single vote for any question in the survey.
Which rookie is being most overlooked?
T-1st: Ricky Ledo, Dallas, Erik Murphy, Chicago, Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia & Kelly Olynyk, Boston -- 8.6 percent
T-5th: Isaiah Canaan, Houston, Allen Crabbe, Portland, Jamaal Franklin, Memphis, Solomon Hill, Indiana, Peyton Siva, Detroit & Tony Snell, Chicago -- 5.7 percent
Others receiving votes: Steven Adams, Oklahoma City; Reggie Bullock, L.A. Clippers; Trey Burke, Utah; Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Detroit; James Ennis, Miami; Ray McCallum, Sacramento; C.J. McCollum, Portland; Tony Mitchell, Detroit; Mike Muscala, Atlanta; Otto Porter, Washington; Glen Rice Jr., Washington
Worth noting: As usual, this question got a ton of different responses. And just like last year, we had a four-way tie at three votes apiece. This year's list of 21 vote-getters includes seven of the 14 lottery picks and two guys -- Ennis and Muscala -- who will be playing overseas.
Which rookie is the most athletic?
1: Tony Mitchell, Detroit -- 47.2 percent

2: Victor Oladipo, Orlando -- 16.7 percent
3: Ben McLemore, Sacramento -- 13.9 percent
T-4th: Shane Larkin, Dallas & Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia -- 5.6 percent
Others receiving votes: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Detroit; Jamaal Franklin, Memphis; Archie Goodwin, Phoenix; Peyton Siva, Detroit
Worth noting: Voters may have been influenced by Mitchell's performance in an impromptu dunk contest about midway through the photo shoot.
Which rookie is the best shooter?
Ben McLemore: Day in the Life
1. Ben McLemore, Sacramento -- 19.4 percent
2. Reggie Bullock, L.A. Clippers -- 16.7 percent
T-3rd: C.J. McCollum, Portland & Tony Snell, Chicago -- 13.9 percent
5: Tim Hardaway Jr., New York -- 11.1 percent
T-6th: Allen Crabbe, Portland & Erik Murphy, Chicago -- 5.6 percent
Others receiving votes: Trey Burke, Utah; Grant Jerrett, Oklahoma City; Ryan Kelly, L.A. Lakers; Jeff Withey, New Orleans; Nate Wolters, Milwaukee
Worth noting: McLemore may have won this category by more if he didn't shoot a brutal 7-for-36 (19 percent) from 3-point range at the Las Vegas Summer League.
Which rookie is the best defender?
GameTime: Victor Oladipo
1: Victor Oladipo, Orlando -- 62.9 percent
T-2nd: Solomon Hill, Indiana, Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia & Peyton Siva -- 5.7 percent
Others receiving votes: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Detroit; Archie Goodwin, Phoenix; Grant Jerrett, Oklahoma City; Ricky Ledo, Dallas; Ben McLemore, Sacramento; Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City; Jeff Withey, New Orleans
Worth noting: Oladipo was easily the most overwhelming winner in any category and the Magic could obviously use any help they can get, having ranked 25th in defensive efficiency last season. Siva didn't win any category, but earns this year's "Mr. Versatility" award for receiving votes on six of the first eight questions. Not bad for a second round pick who almost didn't have a roster spot.
Which rookie is the best playmaker?
1: Trey Burke, Utah -- 47.1 percent
Burke's Summer League
2: Michael Carter-Williams, Philadelphia -- 17.6 percent
T-3rd: Isaiah Canaan, Houston, Shane Larkin, Dallas, C.J. McCollum, Portland & Peyton Siva, Detroit -- 5.9 percent
Others receiving votes: Ricky Ledo, Dallas; Ray McCallum, Sacramento; Victor Oladipo, Orlando; Glen Rice Jr., Washington
Worth noting: Carter-Williams is more of a true point guard, having averaged 74 assists per 100 field goal attempts for Syracuse last year. But Burke (46 per 100) certainly knows how to get his own shot.
