Which rookie will be the 2015-16 Rookie of the Year?
The Starters: Jahlil Okafor
The Sixers' Jahlil Okafor plays a game of 'Fact Checking With Jahlil' with the Starters crew.

1. Jahlil Okafor, Philadelphia -- 41.9 percent
2. Stanley Johnson, Detroit -- 19.4 percent
3. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota -- 12.9 percent
T-4. Emmanuel Mudiay, Denver -- 9.7 percent
D'Angelo Russell, L.A. Lakers -- 9.7 percent
Others receiving votes: Willie Cauley-Stein, Sacramento; Trey Lyles, Utah
Last year: Jabari Parker -- 52.8 percent
Worth noting: The No. 3 pick got almost twice as many votes as Nos. 1 and 2 combined. Other rookies will get the opportunity to put up numbers, but no team needs its rookie's offense more than the Sixers. Scoring 10.0 points per 100 possessions fewer than the league average last season, they were the worst offensive team in the last 12 years.
Which rookie will have the best career?
First Impressions of Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor discusses his first games in a Sixers uniform while his coach and fans weigh in on the rookie's on-court performance.

1. Jahlil Okafor, Philadelphia -- 24.1 percent
2. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota -- 17.2 percent
T-3. Justin Anderson, Dallas -- 13.8 percent
Emmanuel Mudiay, Denver -- 13.8 percent
5. Stanley Johnson, Detroit -- 8.0 percent
6. Sam Dekker, Houston -- 6.9 percent
Others receiving votes: Willie Cauley-Stein, Sacramento; Bobby Portis, Chicago; Kelly Oubre, Washington; Kristaps Porzingis, New York; D'Angelo Russell, L.A. Lakers; Rashad Vaughn, Milwaukee
Last year: Jabari Parker -- 45.9 percent
Worth noting: Towns seemed to be the obvious No. 1 pick for the Wolves, but didn't get much love from his fellow rookies. Four of the 36 couldn't vote for him, but 32 could, and he picked up just 10 total votes.
Which rookie was the biggest steal at where he was selected in the Draft?
1. Joseph Young (43), Indiana -- 12.1 percent
T-2. R.J. Hunter (28), Boston -- 9.1 percent
Tyus Jones (24), Minnesota -- 9.1 percent
Bobby Portis (22), Chicago -- 9.1 percent
Justise Winslow (10), Miami -- 9.1 percent
6. Terry Rozier (16), Boston -- 6.1 percent
Myles Turner (11), Indiana -- 6.1 percent
Others receiving votes: Devin Booker (13), Phoenix; Anthony Brown (34), L.A. Lakers; Willie Cauley-Stein (6), Sacramento; Jerian Grant (19), New York; Dakari Johnson (48), Oklahoma City; Stanley Johnson (8), Detroit; Trey Lyles (12), Utah; Jarell Martin (25), Memphis; Jordan Mickey (33), Boston; Emmanuel Mudiay (7), Denver; Jahlil Okafor (3), Philadelphia; Kristaps Porzingis (4), New York; Josh Richardson (40), Miami; Rashad Vaughn (17), Milwaukee
Last year: Kyle Anderson -- 11.1 percent
Worth noting: We changed the wording on this question (from "Which rookie is being most overlooked?"), and it still get the biggest mix of responses. Nine of the 11 picks from 3-13 (all except Mario Hezonja and Frank Kaminsky) got at least one vote.
Which rookie is the most athletic?
Anderson's Rim Rocker
Justin Anderson throws the hammer down.

1. Justin Anderson, Dallas -- 27.8 percent
2. Pat Connaughton, Portland -- 13.9 percent
3. Willie Cauley-Stein, Sacramento -- 11.1 percent
4. Justise Winslow, Miami -- 8.3 percent
T-5. Mario Hezonja, Orlando -- 5.6 percent
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Brooklyn -- 5.6 percent
J.P. Tokoto, Philadelphia -- 5.6 percent
8. Kelly Oubre, Washington -- 4.2 percent
Others receiving votes: Montrezl Harrell, Houston; Stanley Johnson, Detroit; Jarell Martin, Memphis; Chris McCullough, Brooklyn; Michael Qualls; Terry Rozier, Boston; Marcus Thornton, Boston
Last year: Zach LaVine -- 56.6 percent
Worth noting: This category usually doesn't get such a variety of responses. Maybe there are a lot of great athletes in this rookie class and maybe there's just nobody that stands out like LaVine did last year. Two of the guys who got votes -- McCullough and Qualls -- suffered torn ACLs in the last year.
Which rookie is the best shooter?
The Starters: Devin Booker
Suns rookie Devin Booker's NBA.com profile page is blank, so The Starters asked him some basic questions to help fill it out.

1. Devin Booker, Phoenix -- 58.8 percent
T-2. Pat Connaughton, Portland -- 8.8 percent
R.J. Hunter, Boston -- 8.8 percent
4. Anthony Brown, L.A. Lakers -- 5.9 percent
Mario Hezonja, Orlando -- 5.9 percent
Others receiving votes: Tyler Harvey, Orlando; Stanley Johnson, Detroit; Kelly Oubre, Washington; Rashad Vaughn, Milwaukee
Last year: Doug McDermott -- 39.5 percent
Worth noting: Booker, who shot 40 percent from 3-point range and 88 percent from the free-throw line in Summer League, was the only player to receive more than half of the votes for any question.
Which rookie is the best defender?
Hollis-Jefferson's Big Block
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson denies Jamal Jones at the rim.

1. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Brooklyn -- 23.5 percent
2. Stanley Johnson, Detroit -- 20.6 percent
3. Justise Winslow, Miami -- 17.6 percent
T-4. Willie Cauley-Stein, Sacramento -- 5.9 percent
Delon Wright, Toronto -- 5.9 percent
Others receiving votes: Justin Anderson, Dallas; Anthony Brown, L.A. Lakers; Rakeem Christmas, Indiana; Jerian Grant, New York; Montrezl Harrell, Houston; Kelly Oubre, Washington; Josh Richardson, Miami; Edy Tavares, Atlanta; Joseph Young, Indiana
Last year: K.J. McDaniels, Marcus Smart -- 13.5 percent
Worth noting: All the guys who received multiple votes will play for teams that ranked in the bottom 12 in defensive efficiency last season. Rookies seldom make a positive impact on that end of the floor, but for the teams they've joined, these five guys probably can't hurt.
Which rookie is the best playmaker?
After Dark: D'Angelo Russell
Rick talks some hoops and hits golf balls with Lakers rookie D'Angelo Russell.

1. D'Angelo Russell, L.A. Lakers -- 40.0 percent
2. Tyus Jones, Minnesota -- 17.1 percent
3. Emmanuel Mudiay, Denver -- 14.3 percent
4. Delon Wright, Toronto -- 8.6 percent
T-5. Cameron Payne, Oklahoma City -- 5.7 percent
Joseph Young, Indiana -- 5.7 percent
Others receiving votes: Jerian Grant, New York; Kelly Oubre, Washington; Terry Rozier, Boston
Last year: Tyler Ennis -- 24.3 percent
Worth noting: This was the only question for which Stanley Johnson didn't get a vote. He wins the "Jack of all trades" award with votes for seven different questions. Kelly Oubre (six) and Willie Cauley-Stein (five) also seem to be versatile, but didn't win any categories either.
