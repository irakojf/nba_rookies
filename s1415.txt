Which rookie will be the 2014-15 Rookie of the Year?
Jabari Parker Heats Up Summer League
1: Jabari Parker, Milwaukee -- 52.8 percent
T-2: Doug McDermott, Chicago -- 8.3 percent
Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland -- 8.3 percent
T-4: Shabazz Napier, Miami -- 5.6 percent
Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia -- 5.6 percent
Elfrid Payton, Orlando -- 5.6 percent
Others receiving votes: Aaron Gordon, Orlando; Rodney Hood, Utah; Julius Randle, L.A. Lakers; Marcus Smart, Boston; T.J. Warren, Phoenix
Last year: C.J. McCollum & Victor Oladipo -- 24.2 percent
Worth noting: "He has a complete overall game," one rookie said of Parker. "And he's always in an attack mind set." Nerlens Noel topped our Rookie Ladder at the conclusion of Summer League, but might not have been on most of the rookies' minds on Sunday, because he wasn't in their Draft class or at the Photo Shoot.
Which rookie will have the best career?
All-Access: Zach LaVine
1: Jabari Parker, Milwaukee -- 45.9 percent
2: Doug McDermott, Chicago -- 13.5 percent
3: T.J. Warren, Phoenix -- 8.1 percent
T-4: Zach LaVine, Minnesota -- 5.4 percent
Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland -- 5.4 percent
Others receiving votes: Kyle Anderson, San Antonio; Cleanthony Early, New York; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia; Gary Harris, Denver; Rodney Hood, Utah; Mitch McGary, Oklahoma City; Johnny O'Bryant, Milwaukee; Noah Vonleh, Charlotte
Last year: Victor Oladipo & Kelly Olynyk -- 18.2 percent
Worth noting: The Suns' T.J. Warren gets the "Jack of all trades, master of none" award for this Rookie Survey. He got eight total votes, but in six different categories, with this being the only question he got multiple votes on. Only No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins also got votes on six different questions.
Which rookie is being most overlooked?
1: Kyle Anderson, San Antonio -- 11.1 percent

T-2: Mitch McGary, Oklahoma City -- 8.3 percent
Glen Robinson III, Minnesota -- 8.3 percent
C.J. Wilcox, L.A. Clippers -- 8.3 percent
T-5: Gary Harris, Denver -- 5.6 percent
K.J. McDaniels, Philadelphia -- 5.6 percent
Doug McDermott, Chicago -- 5.6 percent
Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland -- 5.6 percent
James Young, Boston -- 5.6 percent
Others receiving votes: Jordan Adams, Memphis; Jordan Clarkson, L.A. Lakers; Spencer Dinwiddie, Detroit; Cleanthony Early, New York; Aaron Gordon, Orlando; P.J. Hairston, Charlotte; Rodney Hood, Utah; Zach LaVine, Minnesota; Marcus Smart, Boston; Russ Smith, New Orleans; Jarnell Stokes, Memphis; Noah Vonleh, Charlotte; T.J. Warren, Phoenix
Last year: Ricky Ledo, Erik Murphy, Nerlens Noel & Kelly Olynyk -- 8.6 percent
Worth noting: As usual, this question got the biggest variety of responses, including six Lottery picks. One rookie thinks McGary is set to open some eyes, having missed most of last season due to injury. "He's going to be a really good role player for [the Thunder]," the unnamed rook said. "He's going to bust his tail and earn himself a spot." Maybe the winner should have been No. 5 pick Dante Exum, who got only two total votes on this whole survey, in part because he was absent from the Photo Shoot.
Which rookie is the most athletic?
Dunk of the Night - Zach LaVine
1: Zach LaVine, Minnesota -- 56.6 percent
2: Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland -- 30.3 percent
3: Aaron Gordon, Orlando -- 10.5 percent
4: Cleanthony Early, New York -- 2.6 percent
Last year: Tony Mitchell -- 47.2 percent
Worth noting: LaVine got the most votes on any single question, and Wiggins got the most of any second-place finisher. After seeing LaVine's and Wiggins' contributions to this Vine thread, it's clear that the voters know what they're talking about.
Which rookie is the best shooter?
McDermott Shines During Summer League
1: Doug McDermott, Chicago -- 39.5 percent
2: Nik Stauskas, Sacramento -- 26.3 percent
3: Joe Harris, Cleveland -- 13.2 percent
4: P.J. Hairston, Charlotte -- 5.3 percent
5: C.J. Wilcox, L.A. Clippers -- 5.3 percent
Others receiving votes: Jordan Adams, Memphis; Gary Harris, Denver; Rodney Hood, Utah; T.J. Warren, Phoenix
Last year: Ben McLemore -- 19.4 percent
Worth noting: McBuckets shot 12-for-27 (44 percent) from 3-point range and 22-for-23 (96 percent) from the free throw line at Summer League. Pretty, pretty, pretty good. "His shot is so pure," one rookie said Sunday. "He has the calmest game," another, who said McDermott would have the best career, added. "He's very patient."
Which rookie is the best defender?
T-1: K.J. McDaniels, Philadelphia -- 13.5 percent
All-Access: Gary Harris
Marcus Smart, Boston -- 13.5 percent
T-3: Gary Harris, Denver -- 10.8 percent
Elfrid Payton, Orlando -- 10.8 percent
T-5: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia -- 8.1 percent
Aaron Gordon, Orlando -- 8.1 percent
Russ Smith, New Orleans -- 8.1 percent
T-8: Adreian Payne, Atlanta -- 5.4 percent
Noah Vonleh, Charlotte -- 5.4 percent
Others receiving votes: Thanasis Antetokounmpo, New York; Joe Harris, Cleveland; Josh Huestis, Oklahoma City; Nerlens Noel, Philadelphia; Julius Randle, L.A. Lakers; Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland
Last year: Victor Oladipo -- 62.9 percent
Worth noting: The Magic and Sixers each had two guys in the top seven (even with most voters seemingly forgetting about Noel), good news for coaches Jacque Vaughn and Brett Brown, respectively. When talking about Aaron Gordon, one rookie noted how good of a defensive program Sean Miller has been running at Arizona. "They're typically at the top of the college basketball defensive ratings." Gordon, the same rookie noted, "can defend multiple positions and is good on ball screens." There was no "smartest rookie" question, but we nominate that guy.
Which rookie is the best playmaker?
Rookie Hustle
1: Tyler Ennis, Phoenix -- 24.3 percent
2: Kyle Anderson, San Antonio -- 18.9 percent
3: Marcus Smart, Boston -- 13.5 percent
T-4: Dante Exum, Utah -- 5.4 percent
Doug McDermott, Chicago -- 5.4 percent
Shabazz Napier, Miami -- 5.4 percent
Elfrid Payton, Orlando -- 5.4 percent
Others receiving votes: Jerami Grant, Philadelphia; Zach LaVine, Minnesota; Jabari Parker, Milwaukee; Nik Stauskas, Sacramento; T.J. Warren, Phoenix; Andrew Wiggins, Cleveland
Last year: Trey Burke -- 47.1 percent
Worth noting: Ennis is obviously a more traditional point guard and, as a Canadian, gets to work with Steve Nash in the summer. Anderson, who is 6-foot-9 and averaged 6.5 assists in his last year at UCLA, should be fun to watch in the Spurs' system. "He's always been a pass-first facilitator," another rookie said.
